# Snake-Bot

This notebook program plays google's snake game in the browser.  This is done by tracing a pattern down the middle of the grid and going up the sides such that the snake will pass over all cells.
Eventually, the snake will become too large and run into its tail (or succumb to an unfortunate glitch, depending on the strength of the wifi connection).

This program depends on pyautogui and selenium for browser automation.
